About the Project: Dino Game in Python
 Project Overview

This is a Chrome-style Dinosaur Game clone built entirely in Python using the Pygame library.
It’s a fun and educational project that demonstrates game development fundamentals, including animation, physics, collision detection, scoring, and user input handling — all without external assets.

🌟 Key Features

✅ Smooth-running dinosaur with jump and duck controls
✅ Randomly generated obstacles (cactus & flying bird)
✅ Increasing difficulty as score increases
✅ Realistic gravity and jumping physics
✅ High-score saving system (highscore.txt)
✅ Simple yet clean art style (no external images required)
✅ Restart and main menu screen
✅ Optimized for smooth performance on any system

🕹️ Controls

🧠 Learning Outcomes

By creating this project, you’ll learn:

How to use Pygame for real-time 2D games

How to handle input and animations

How to implement physics (gravity/jump)

How to manage game states (running, game over, restart)

How to save data (high score)

How to design your own sprites and logic

💡 Ideas for Future Improvements

You can make this project even better by adding:

🦕 Animated dinosaur sprite (running legs, blinking eyes)

🌄 Background scrolling (desert effect)

🌤️ Day-night cycle or color themes

🎵 Background music and jump sound effects

🏆 Leaderboard system

📱 Mobile control support (touch)
