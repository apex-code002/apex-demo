This code is a Python script for a highly customizable, professional focus timer that utilizes time management techniques like the Pomodoro method. It is designed to help a user structure their work session by alternating between focused work blocks and structured breaks.Key Features and Concepts ðŸ’¡1. Sequential Custom SchedulingInstead of using fixed durations for every round, this timer allows the user to define a unique work time and short break time for every single block in their session. This is handled professionally using a namedtuple called SessionBlock within a TimerConfig class, allowing for variable and personalized scheduling.2. Time Management StructureThe core logic implements a structure for productivity:Work Blocks: The primary phase for focused work.Short Breaks: Used for quick recovery between work blocks.Long Breaks: Programmed to occur automatically after a set number of cycles (by default, every 4 blocks) to prevent burnout and ensure deep rest.3. Non-Blocking Audio Alerts ðŸ””The script uses the simpleaudio library to play an alarm sound when any countdown (Work, Short Break, or Long Break) finishes. Crucially, this audio playback is non-blocking, meaning the program does not freeze while the sound plays, ensuring the next phase of the timer starts immediately after the alert.4. Professional Design and UXObject-Oriented Design: The TimerConfig class handles all configuration, setup, and input validation, making the main logic clean and modular.Input Validation: The code prevents crashes by checking if user inputs for times and rounds are valid numbers.Clear Console Interface: It uses os.system('clear') to keep the console tidy and \r (carriage return) within the countdown function to update the timer in place, providing a continuous, professional display.Summary of Libraries UsedLibraryPurposetimeUsed for pausing the script (time.sleep(1)) to control the countdown sequence.osUsed for clearing the console (os.system('cls' or 'clear')) for a clean user experience.simpleaudioUsed for playing the audio alert when a timer finishes (non-blocking audio).collections.namedtupleUsed to create a clean, immutable structure (SessionBlock) for storing each round's work and break times.
